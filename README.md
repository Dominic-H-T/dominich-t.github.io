Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Dominic (Does not rhyme as well, sadly)

Hello person from the internet, it's time to learn all about ME.

My name is Dominic, and I am a Computer Science Undergrad Student in the PNW of the US.

I am hoping to get into cybersecurity, preferably blue, but I know I need some red teaming to be good at Blue

I am open for work or internships

I do most of my coding in the evening after dinner, and check my email and messages in the morning. If you have any questions, contact me here [fill in later]
